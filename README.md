## Work Experience
### Data Scientest @ Prof. Rafi Haddad lab â€“ Researching Neural Circuits
- [Utilized classical ML techniques such as PCA, k-means, SVM, Random Forest,
DBSCAN, and Logistic Regression on neural time series data,To Extracted and classified subsets 
of neural activities.](https://github.com/orbashangit/Example_of_single_PC_neuron_results-.git)
-	[Built an automated spike sorting pipeline, by applying signal processing and machine learning techniques on neuronal time series data.](https://github.com/orbashangit/Online_Spike_Sorting_NeuroNexus_Probe.git)
- Implemented deep learning algorithms (CNN, RNN) to analyze relationships among cortical 
neuron networks.
