## Work Experience
** Data Scientest @ Prof. Rafi Haddad lab â€“ Researching Neural Circuits 
- Utilized classical ML techniques such as PCA, k-means, SVM, Random Forest,
DBSCAN, and Logistic Regression on neural time series data,To Extracted and classified subsets 
of neural activities.
- Implemented deep learning algorithms (CNN, RNN) to analyze relationships among cortical 
neuron networks.
-	Built an automated spike sorting pipeline, by applying signal processing and machine learning techniques on neuronal time series data.
